# Automated Farmer – Code-to-Grow Game

A programming-driven automation game where players write Python code to control a farmer in a grid-based world. The game is built with a C++ simulation engine, OpenGL rendering, Python scripting, and SQL persistence.

## 🛠️ Development Setup (READ THIS FIRST)

### 🚫 Do NOT commit the `build/` folder
The `build/` directory contains machine-specific files generated by CMake (object files, binaries, cache files).  
**It must NOT be pushed to GitHub.**

Each developer generates their own local `build/` directory.

This project follows standard C++ / CMake best practices:
- Source code is committed
- Build artifacts are generated locally

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **CMake** ≥ 3.16  
- **C++ Compiler** with C++17 support  
- **OpenGL 3.3 Core**
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Git**

### Libraries (already included in repo)
- GLFW
- GLAD (OpenGL 3.3 Core)
- stb_image

## 🔧 How to Build (All Teammates)

From the **project root**:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

To run the program:

```bash
./automated_farmer
```

Clean Rebuild:
```bash
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## ✅ Build Sanity Check

Your setup is correct if:
- The project builds with no errors
- A window titled **“OpenGL Test”** opens
- The screen clears to a solid color
- The window closes cleanly
